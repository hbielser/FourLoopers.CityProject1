## Summary
Our motivation behind this project was to find out if certain environmental or social factors had an impact on a county's fair health score. According to countyhealthrankings.org, our main source of data for this project, they say the "Poor or Fair Health measures the percentage of adults in a county who consider themselves to be in poor or fair health". We decided to take our backgrounds and interests into account for how we were going to narrow down our quesitions to ultimately come up with the hypothesis: If a county has poor socioeconomic factors, then the poor or fair health percentage will be greater than counties with more favorable socioeconomic factors.

We asked these 3 questions and recieved the followed results:


## What is the correlation between fair health percentage and the type of food nearby?
  - There was moderate correlation between the poor and fair health percentage and the food index (access to grocery stores and being able to afford the food provided). Though access to food and the types of food available in correlation to the poor and fair health percentage where a major reason for the idea behind this project, we did find that the food available by county did not impact the health percentage as much as we had imagined.

## What is the correlation between fair health percentage and excessive drinking?
  - There is a moderate correlation between the poor and fair health percentage and excessive drinking. Excessive drinking is measured on the percentage of of county's adult population that reports binge or heavy drinking in the past 30 days. From this we can gather that though drinking causes health issues and can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle, it doesn't have enough of an impact on the poor or fair health percentage to cause any worry on to the county's measured.

## What is the correlation between fair health percentage and physical activity?
  - There was a strong correlation between being physically unhealthy and the poor and fair health percentage. As every physician and physical education teacher has engrained in us since elementary school, being physically unhealthy does have a negative impact on our health which is shown in the correlation between the physically unhealthy and poor and fair health percentage. We did further find that mental unhealthiness also had a strong correlation with the poor or fair health index.

Overall we found 3 insights that we hope to look into in the future:

# Poor health is concentrated in southern states 
# There is a weak correlation between fair health and the income ratio by county (.286)
# What is the prevalence of fast food and unheatlhy food options by county and why is there a moderate correlation between the food deprivation index and the poor and fair health percentage?
